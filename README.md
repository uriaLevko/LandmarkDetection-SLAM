# LandmarkDetection-SLAM
Landmark Detection &amp; Robot Tracking (SLAM)
Project Overview
In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! Youâ€™ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.

*Below is an example of a 2D robot world with landmarks (purple x's) and the robot (a red 'o') located and found using *only* sensor and motion data collected by that robot. This is just one example for a 50x50 grid world; in your work you will likely generate a variety of these maps.*

Project Instructions
The project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures, only Notebook 3 and the robot_class.py file will be graded:

[__Notebook 1__](./1.%20Robot%20Moving%20and%20Sensing.ipynb) : Robot Moving and Sensing

[__Notebook 2__](./2.%20Omega%20and%20Xi%2C%20Constraints.ipynb) : Omega and Xi, Constraints 

[__Notebook 3__](./3.%20Landmark%20Detection%20and%20Tracking%20(2).ipynb) : Landmark Detection and Tracking 

You can also view the helper files writen as part of this project.

[__helper__](./helpers.py) : Init module for robot control

[__Robot__](./robot_class.py): Init module for robot sensing
